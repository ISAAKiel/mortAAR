</h2>
<p>Life tables have only a marginal position in archaeological research,
for different reasons. Columns with rows of multidigit numbers carrying
strange labels can be daunting, and indeed the mathematics behind the
construction of life tables based on modern census data are not for the
faint-of-heart. Compared to life tables based on real census data,
archaeological ones are more straightforward, but their interpretation
carries its own problems. First and foremost, they pretend to have a
degree of exactness which is not supported by the underlying data. This
is another reason why life-tables are considered with a certain degree
of suspiciousness by archaeologists. And finally, despite the fact that
the construction of archaeological life tables can be straightforward,
it involves a lot of computation and number-crunching compared to other
methods used in the archaeological discourse. To our current knowledge,
an easy to use and accessible tool for computing life tables is missing.
This is why we sat down and created mortAAR for R. We hope it will be of
use for archaeologists world-wide.</p>
<p>From an outer appearance, life tables from modern census data and
archaeological ones, like generated by mortAAR, look very similar. For
modern census data, though, there are far more sophisticated measures
available. We cannot go into more detail here but refer the reader to
the abundant literature on demography and life table construction.</p>
<p>However, perhaps even more important than the different methods of
computing, are the differences in input data. Due to infrastructure,
modern census data of developed countries can be regarded as fairly
complete and comprehensive. This is, of course, not true for
archaeological data. Life tables from modern census data are important
tools for inferring the prospective development of a given population.
This is, of course, not possible for archaeological data sets. Most of
the time, we have to assume that we are dealing with a stationary
population.</p>

</h2>
<p>In our view, mortAAR shines in the following areas:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ease-and-flexibility-of-the-input">Ease and flexibility of the input<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ease-and-flexibility-of-the-input"></a>
</h3>
<p>We worked hard to allow the user as many customisations as feasible.
First and foremost, the tables can have many different kinds of
formatting. A single individual approach is supported as well as already
pooled data (e.g., from an already existing life table). In the latter
case, the user has to specify a numerical variable which defines the
count of each age class.</p>
<p>In most data sets, the date ranges are defined rather loosely,
reflecting the belief that one year more or less does not count taking
the basic methods of age estimation into account. However, for the
construction of life tables it should be obvious that 20–40 is not the
same as 20–39.In the former case the individual in question will also
contribute to the age class of 40–44 (using 5-year-classes). Therefore,
the user should check the methodology the data-set uses carefully - if
they did not generate it themselves. To spare the user the possible
inconvenience to transform the data to match any given methodology, both
possibilities – labelled „included“ (e.g., 20–39) and „excluded“
(e.g. 20–40) – are made available.</p>
<p>The custom method of constructing the life table follows the approach
used in modern data. It uses 5 year-classes, except for the youngest
class. Following Ascadi and Nemeskeri <span class="citation">(1970)</span>, for Central Europe it has become
practice to publish either the full life table or a collapsed form with
five year-intervals <span class="citation">(Herrmann et al. 1990,
304ff.; Kokkotidis and Richter 1991)</span>. However, in the
international demographic discourse <span class="citation">(e.g.,
Keyfitz and Flieger 1968)</span>, the first 5-year-age group is
subdivided into those having died in their first year of life (0) and
those having died in the second to fifth year (1–4). Because the
differences are highly relevant in many archaeological contexts and the
information is also – contrary to the possibilities in the higher age
groups – anthropologically available, we decided to choose this as
default methodology. With that, we hope to enhance the comparability of
historic or present-day demographic data with that of archaeological
origin. However, if the user has good reasons to do it differently, they
are also allowed to define their own age classes. Furthermore, the user
is encouraged to define any possible variable as a grouping variable.
For an individual cemetery, this will mostly include the sex of the
deceased, but it might as well be defined as marking different
populations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sophisticated-means-of-computation">Sophisticated means of computation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sophisticated-means-of-computation"></a>
</h3>
<p>To get discrete age classes from time spans of individuals or groups
of individuals, as they are usually provided by anthropological studies,
the time span is spread across single years; the individual values for
these years are afterwards pooled together to whichever age class the
user chose initially. It is tempting to define different kernels for the
spreading process (e.g., Gaussian), but in our view this solution would
not reflect the anthropological diagnosis correctly: An individual
diagnosed of being of adult age in Central European terminology – that
is, 20 to 39 years old – has the same chances of being in reality, say,
22 or 38. The Gaussian kernel, however, would imply the highest
probability of it being 30 years. This is why we decided to follow an
equi-divisional approach <span class="citation">(called “proportional”
by J. L. Boldsen 1988)</span>. Each year of the reported time interval
of an individual or a group of individuals is assigned the same value,
essentially the same probability of being the true age.</p>
<p>While the general steps for computing an archaeological life table
are straightforward – leaving idiosyncrasies like the choice of the size
of the radix and the exact formulas aside –, that is: all formulas
circulating in archaeological textbooks reach the same results (except
possible rounding errors), one detail tends to be overlooked. This
detail concerns the average number of years lived by an individual that
died within a specific age class (here called A(x) following the UN
tables, elsewhere specified as „nax“). A(x) is of importance for
computing L(x), the overall number of years lived within an age class,
ultimately used to calculate life expectancy and the reconstruction of
population. In virtually all archaeological text books, A(x) is defined
as a/2, essentially splitting the length of the age interval in question
in half. As we cannot know the exact date of death, given the current
set of age estimation methods, this method seems beneficial for the
beginning. The verdict of N. Keyfitz <span class="citation">(1977,
13)</span> – „The uniform distribution of deaths […] leads to nax = n/2,
but this is not acceptable when the age interval n is as wide as 5
years.“ – has certainly its validity when dealing with modern census
data, but might be disregarded for older individuals, as the empirical
value for age classes &gt; 5 years is very close to 2.5, the computed
value (empirically, it mostly hovers between 2.45 and 2.65 as older
individuals tend to die later than within the middle of their class.
This is far more difficult to generalize than for the younger age
classes [see below]). Interestingly, this problem is valid even for
empiric modern life tables for the first age group (0-1 years) where the
age of death is recorded only in years, not in months. It seems that
Keyfitz <span class="citation">(1970, 31)</span> was the first to assume
a value for nax to overcome this problem. From empirical data, he came
to the following values for the youngest age classes:
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>0.07</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>1.7</mn><msub><mi>M</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a_0 = 0.07 + 1.7M_0</annotation></semantics></math>,
and for ages from 1 to 4 to
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi></mi><mn>4</mn></msub><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1.5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">_4a_1 = 1.5</annotation></semantics></math>.
Elsewhere <span class="citation">(Keyfitz 1977)</span> he has called
this the “separation factor”. Contrary to intuition, this separation
factor for the youngest age groups is relatively small in developed
countries (e.g., ibid. p. 15), but large in developing countries or
historical data (and, supposedly, also in prehistoric times). This means
that if young children die at all in developed countries, they do this
very young. In life tables of developing countries, the average of lived
years for a=0 and a=1–4 hovers around 0.3 and 1.3, thus, we decided to
approximate A(x) for age classes &lt;5 with a/3, as we think that taking
the separation factor into account is well backed by empirical data
<span class="citation">(also implied by Chamberlain 2006, 30; for
anthropological data already: Weiss and Wobst 1973, 37)</span>. The
computation with this factor is the default setting. However, if the
user does not agree, she is, of course, able to supply her own factor
values or to disregard the factor approach altogether.</p>

<p>mortAAR provides life tables for every group the user specified and
on its own one table for all groups combined. Furthermore, it allows to
visualize the resulting data sets via curve plots. The user can simply
click through the plots for the different key values and thereby get a
clear picture about the specificities of each data set, also – if more
than one category was specified – about the differences between the data
sets.</p>
<p>Finally, we added the reconstruction of age distribution of the given
population as an additional column (rel_popx). This is usually not
provided by modern standard life tables. Following Kokkotidis and
Richter <span class="citation">(1991, 227)</span>, this is achieved by
dividing L(x) by T0 <span class="citation">(for a different equation see
Weiss and Wobst 1973, 38)</span>.</p>

representativeness and to correct them if necessary. Furthermore, the
package offers the computation of indices that provide information about
different aspects of the reproduction of the population in question.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>Currently, paleodemography seems to undergo a sea change. While the
early criticism from the early 1980s about the representation of aging
characteristics <span class="citation">(Bocquet-Appel and Masset
1982)</span> had been fervidly been rebutted <span class="citation">(e.g., Van Gerven and Armelagos 1983)</span>, the
problems of getting to mortality patterns is now common knowledge. Some
recent solutions by paleodemographers have been to remodel life tables,
to introduce complex statistic measurements like Bayesian statistics or
to revert the logic of aging skeletons <span class="citation">(see the
examples in Hoppa and Vaupel 2002)</span>.</p>
<p>Our own attempt on life tables is (still) a far cry from the recent
course of research. The reason why we still think this method is valid
is simple: While we do not dismiss the problems of life tables with
their assumption of stationary populations, we still think that even in
their simple form they provide useful information, not necessarily for
the paleodemographist, but for the archaeologist. What tends to be
forgotten is that the treatment of the deceased is always a conscious
decision of the surviving members of the society in question. Even the
non-treatment of the dead, e.g., by excarnation, still demands a
decision. Therefore, even if the age-pattern is as distorted as in the
examples above – and it remains the question if such a situation should
not be regarded as the norm for much of prehistory –, it still provides
highly relevant information about cultural behaviour and preferences. To
elucidate even more hints on prehistoric practices it is of primordial
importance that archaeologists, anthropologists and paleodemographers
work closer together than they have in the past to get to grips with
actual population developments, representation of burial data and
possible sources of bias. If our package helps in this process, we would
be more than happy.</p>
