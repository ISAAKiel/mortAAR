## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Made sure that the NOTE "Lost braces; missing escapes or markup?" disappears.

## Increment patch
This is a minor increment. In this version we have:
- fixed the error in plotting that occurred after the fix of "aes_string" of ggplot2
  and that still persisted
- fixed some typos
- added links to DESCRIPTION
- added more helpful error message if grouping variable contains NAs

* macOS builder, R 4.3.0

* win-builder (devel and release)
