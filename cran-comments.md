## Increment patch
This is a minor increment. In this version we have:
- fixed the error in plotting that occurred after the fix of "aes_string" of ggplot2
  and that still persisted
- fixed some typos
- added links to Description
- added more helpful error message if grouping variable contains NAs

* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
There was one NOTE on "checking CRAN incoming feasibility".

## Reverse dependencies
