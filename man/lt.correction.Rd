\title{Calculates a corrected life table from a mortAAR life table}
\usage{
lt.correction(life_table, agecor = TRUE, agecorfac = c(),
  option_spline = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{life_table}{an object of class mortaar_life_table.}

\item{agecor}{logical, optional.}

\item{agecorfac}{numeric vector, optional.}

\item{option_spline}{integer, optional.}
}
\value{
a list containing a data.frame with indices e0, 1q0 and 5q0
according to Bocquet-Appel and Masset showing the computed exact value
as well as ranges and an object of class mortaar_life_table with the
corrected values.
\itemize{
  \item \bold{e0}:   Corrected life expectancy.
  \item \bold{1q0}:   Mortality of age group 0--1.
  \item \bold{5q0}:   Mortality of age group 0--5.
}
}
\description{
It is generally assumed that most skeletal populations lack the
youngest age group. Life tables resulting from such populations
will necessarily be misleading as they lead to believe that the
mortality of younger children was lower than it actually was and
that life expectancy was higher. For correcting these missing
individuals, \emph{Bocquet-Appel and Masset} (1977; see also
\emph{Herrmann et al. 1990}, 307) conceived of several
calculations based on regression analyses of modern comparable
mortality data. However, the applicability of these indices
to archaeological data is highly debated and does not necessarily
lead to reliable results. Therefore, the correction needs to be
weighted carefully and ideally only after the representativity of the
base data has been checked with function lt.representativity.
