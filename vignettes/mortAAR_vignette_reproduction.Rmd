For population studies it is of vital importance to estimate growth or decline of a population. For archaeological datasets this is rarely attempted, probably because the data quality seems to scanty. Nevertheless, the calculation of such measures seems worth the try, at least it should give an impression if the resulting values are unrealistic high or low.
There are different approaches to calculate reproduction rates (e. g. \emph{Henneberg 1978}). We largely follow the methodology by \emph{Hassan 1981}. Typically, a Total fertility rate (TFR) of 6-8 is assumed for prehistoric populations (\emph{Ascadi/Nemeskeri 1970}; \emph{Henneberg 1978}; \emph{Hassan 1981}). Recently, \emph{McFadden and Oxenham 2018a} have published a formula to estimate the Total fertility rate from archaeological data, provided that infants are represented fully in the archaeological record.\cr Unfortunately, this will not be the case for most archaeological datasets. Therefore, we used the data published by McFadden and Oxenham to apply it to the P(5-19)-index after \emph{Bocquet-Appel 2002}. We approximated the ratio by three different methods of fitting (linear, logistic, power) and recommend logistic fitting, but the others are available as well.\cr The Gross reproduction rate (GRR) is calculated by multiplying the TFR with the ratio of female newborns, assumed to be a constant of 48.8% of all children (\emph{Hassan} 1981, 136). The Net reproduction rate is arrived at by summing the product of the GRR, the age specific fertility rate as defined by \emph{Hassan} (1981, 137 tab. 8.7) and the age specific survival taken from the life table and dividing the result by 10000.\cr The Rate of natural increase or Intrinsic growth rate r (growth in per cent per year) can be computed from the fertility following \emph{Hassan} (1981, 140). An alternative way to calculate the intrinsic growth rate, has recently described by \emph{McFadden and Oxenham 2018b}. They present a regression calculation based on the index D0--15/D also used for fertility calculations (see above) in connections with modern data. It must not astonish that even with the McFadden/Oxenham-index used for the fertility rate, the actual numbers for the computed intrinisc rate of growth and the Rate of Natural Increase can highly diverge, as with the former formula, further life table data is taken into account.\cr Also calculated is the mortality rate m after \emph{Bocquet-Appel and Masset} (1977) in per cent of a given population which in archaeological case necessarily is the same as the natality rate n because it has to be assumed that the population is stationary. A value of 1.0, for example, means that 1 among 100 individuals died per year. Furthermore, the ratio of dependent individuals is reported that is usually (but probably erroneously for archaic societies (\emph{Grupe et al. 2015}, 423) assumed to apply to those aged below 15 or 60 and above.
